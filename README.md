Interactive historical Atlanta maps showing Auburn and Summerhill

# Leaflet Map Atlanta Website

## Overview

This website provides an interactive map that enables users to explore historical overlays with on-off switches.The application was developed using Leaflet.js, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. 

## How To Use

The map opens centered on a predetermined location, with the "Auburn Ave 1949" overlay enabled by default. The controls for zooming in and out are situated at the top right corner of the map. At the bottom left corner, you will find two buttons for toggling overlay maps:

1. **Auburn Ave 1949**: An overlay with a 1949 map of  Atlanta's Auburn Ave.
2. **Kauffman**: An overlay from a historica 1921 Atlanta map by O.F. Kauffman.

You can toggle these overlays on or off by clicking the corresponding buttons. When a button reads "On", it means that overlay is currently displayed on the map. Clicking the button will turn it "Off" and remove the overlay from the map, and vice versa.

## About Leaflet.js

Leaflet is a widely used open-source JavaScript library for embedding maps in web pages. It is lightweight, modular, and very easy to use. Leaflet works by connecting with various map providers to retrieve tiles, which are small images that represent portions of a map. These tiles are then stitched together in a grid to form the entire map. The library allows users to add layers, including tile layers, markers, and other shapes, enabling rich interaction and visualization capabilities. By using Leaflet, developers can have a high level of control over how maps and overlays behave and interact, making it a popular choice for a variety of mapping applications.
